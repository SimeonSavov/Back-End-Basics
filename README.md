## Section 1: Data Formats - JSON, XML, and YAML (Lesson 1)

### Exercise 1:
- Added initial product data in JSON format for practical exercises.
- Products include details such as name, price, description, and keywords.

### Exercise 2:
- Introduced city data in XML format representing information about various cities.
- Includes city name, country, population, and notable landmarks.

### Exercise 3:
- Added country data in YAML format, providing information on countries, capitals, populations, and spoken languages.

These exercises are part of the "Data Formats" lesson, exploring JSON, XML, and YAML in the context of Back-End Technologies Basics. The datasets serve as valuable resources for hands-on learning and practical application of data formats in backend development.

   - Applied for practical exercises on nested JSON structures and data representation.

### JSON Exercise 2:
   - Added student and course data in JSON format.
   - Utilized for exploring complex JSON structures and relationships.

### YAML Exercise 3:
   - Integrated order data in YAML format.
   - Explored YAML data processing and understanding complex data structures.

### YAML Exercise 4:
   - Introduced reservation data in YAML format.
   - Used for hands-on exercises focusing on YAML structures and nested data.

### XML Exercise 5:
   - Added device data in XML format.
   - Utilized for exploring XML parsing and processing techniques.

### XML Exercise 6:
   - Integrated vehicle data in XML format.
   - Applied for practical exercises on XML parsing and transformation.

### How to Use:
- The associated C# programs demonstrate parsing and processing of data in each format.
- Choose the desired data format exercise by running the program and following on-screen prompts.
