# Back-End Technologies Basics

Welcome to my repository for the 'Back-End Technologies Basics' course in QA Engineering at SoftUni. Here, I will be sharing my exercises.

## Folder:

## Section 1: Data Formats - JSON, XML, and YAML (Lesson 1)

### Exercise 1:
- Added initial product data in JSON format for practical exercises.
- Products include details such as name, price, description, and keywords.

### Exercise 2:
- Introduced city data in XML format representing information about various cities.
- Includes city name, country, population, and notable landmarks.

### Exercise 3:
- Added country data in YAML format, providing information on countries, capitals, populations, and spoken languages.

These exercises are part of the "Data Formats" lesson, exploring JSON, XML, and YAML in the context of Back-End Technologies Basics. The datasets serve as valuable resources for hands-on learning and practical application of data formats in backend development.
